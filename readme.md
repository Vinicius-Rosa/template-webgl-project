# Template for WebGL Projects 

Hi, folks! How is it going? ðŸ˜‰

After some bad experiences with 3D in [another project](https://github.com/Vinicius-Rosa/vaporwave-concept) ðŸ˜… I decided to improve myself in that. So, thats the template I'm using now. I get this from [Bruno Simon](https://bruno-simon.com/) an will adding more cool stuffs on repo.

## How to run
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
